My Dotfiles

This is a git repository with all of my personal dotfiles. 
They're a little sparse, but they have the customizations that I like.
Feel fee to peruse, but I would not recommend forking.
Instead, pick and choose the lines you like and understand and incorporate them into your own dotfiles!

These dotfiles make extensive use of colors. 
Vim will look really silly with solarized unless you configure your terminal correctly.
Make sure $TERM is xterm-256color, or, if using tmux or screen, make sure they report $TERM as screen256. 
The former requires correctly configuring your terminal emulator.
The latter can be changed in .tmux.conf
