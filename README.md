My Dotfiles

This is a git repository with all of my personal dotfiles. 
They're a little sparse, but they have the customizations that I like.
Feel fee to peruse, but I would not recommend forking.
Instead, pick and choose the lines you like and understand and incorporate them into your own dotfiles!
